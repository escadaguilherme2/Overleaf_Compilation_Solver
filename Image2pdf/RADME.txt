To speed up the compilation, images should be in PDF format.

You can do this by placing the Image2pdf file in the folder containing your images and running it.

A copy of each image will be created with a .pdf extension. Afterward, simply update the references in your LaTeX editor.


Recombining the Executable

To reassemble the executable file that was split into parts, follow these steps:

1. Run the `combine_file.bat` script.
2. The original executable file will be recreated as `Image2pdf.exe`.

Important:
If you encounter a security error while running the scripts, you may need to adjust the PowerShell execution policy. To do this:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Run the following command:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
