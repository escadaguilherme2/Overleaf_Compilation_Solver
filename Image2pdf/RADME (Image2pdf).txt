Image2pdf Tool Instructions

The Image2pdf tool is an optional utility to help convert multiple images to PDF format, which can speed up LaTeX compilation by ensuring all images are in PDF format.

How to Use Image2pdf

Option 1: Python Script (`image2pdf.py`)

If you have Python installed, you can directly use the Python script:

1. Copy the `Image2pdf.py` script to the folder containing your images.
2. Run the script to convert your images to pdf format.
3. A pdf copy of each image will be created with the same file name but with a `.pdf` extension.
4. Update the image references in your LaTeX project accordingly.

Option 2: Extract and Use the Executable (`Image2pdf.exe`)

If you prefer using an executable or do not have Python installed, follow these instructions:

Step 1: Extract `Image2pdf.exe`

The `Image2pdf.exe` file is provided in a split 7-Zip format due to GitHub's file size limitations. Follow these steps to extract it:

1. Download the files `Image2pdf.7z.001`, `Image2pdf.7z.002`, etc., from this repository.
2. Use 7-Zip (or another compatible archive tool) to extract the contents:
   - Right-click on `Image2pdf.7z.001` and choose 7-Zip > Extract Here.
   - 7-Zip will automatically combine and extract the files into a single `Image2pdf.exe`.
   
   Important: You must have all the parts of the split archive in the same directory for the extraction to work.

Step 2: Run the Executable

1. Once `Image2pdf.exe` is extracted, copy it to the folder containing your images.
2. Run the executable to convert the images to PDF format.
3. A pdf version of each image will be created with the `.pdf` extension.
4. Update the image references in your LaTeX project accordingly.

You may delete the executable after use if desired.
